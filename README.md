# Bubble Brigade

![Game Cover][cover]

Bubble Brigade is that game you played during your bubble baths when you were a kid. A really big, old kid. It's okay, we won't tell.

Tap the screen to create ripples and push bubbles around. Make your bubble the biggest by running into smaller bubble, but don't run into bigger ones.
